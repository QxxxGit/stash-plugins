# File Backup

Adds a button to scene and image walls to backup the current results to a specified directory.

## Installation

> IMPORTANT! The Stash Userscript Library plugin is required. It also needs the latest patch to relay the scene and image file paths to this plugin.

Run the command below to install stashapp-tools.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Known Bugs

* When removing a filter (pressing the x), the paths aren't updated. Refreshing the page or adding a new filter fixes it. Possibly cached results?

## Future Plans

* Option to archive files into .zip
* Option to preserve directory structure
