# v1.1 (2025-05-11)

## New Features

* Hovering the view count now displays a tooltip of when the scene was last viewed.
* Performer popovers - hovering a performer name displays their picture and age at production.

## Improvements

* Performers at-a-glance now works properly, showing an +X counter of unlisted performers. Clicking this number will display a popover with a vertical list of those performers and their age at production. You'll be able to click those performers to visit their page. To close the popover, click out of it or reclick the counter.

## Notes

* Hid performer popover button at the bottom, since +X counter replaces it.
